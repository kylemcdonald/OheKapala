# OheKapala

Ohe (bamboo) Kapala (stamping) is a Hawaiian technique for printing patterns on clothing and tapa.

I learned about this technique from George at [Maʻona Community Garden](https://www.instagram.com/maonacommunity/) in Honaunau, south of Kona, Hawaiʻi. He said that his patterns "have no top or bottom, no beginning or end", and he uses a flipping and repeating technique when tiling.
